This design is Buck DC switching power supply based on the TI company's Buck Controller LM5117 chip and MOS CSD18532KCS field effect tube. When the rated input DC voltage is about 16V, rated output DC voltage is always maintained above 3.1V. At the same time, it has the over-current protection which is 3.2a. What`s more,it not only has the over-heated and over-current protection,and also has the function of distinguishing the load. More importantly, the efficiency of this system can achieve an excellent goal which means it can reach the rate of 95%. As a result, this system has reached all the requirements after experiment.
